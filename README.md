# blundermate

a chess puzzle game where your objective is to lose. 

puzzles gathered from real blunders made by real humans in real chess games.

this is a 2 in 1 pack, a "puzzle gatherer" and a simple frontend.

it's very crude and i've never deployed it because I couldn't be arsed to (tried doing it in aws ec2 and I'm not cut out for this. vercel doesnt support this. I got bored of the project and moved on)

now I'm releasing this on github omg wow!!!!! I've also included a stockfish executable (it needs it to run) which is probably not legal I don't think but don't quote me on that

feel free to do anything you want with this, just add a credit or something

also this code SUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS this is the first time I've ever touched react. yea this is a few months old
